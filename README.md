# SudokuSolver
My C# Sudoku-solving program.

This is a C# program that solves Sudoku puzzles.  It is not especially elegant.  It uses lots of loops and is rather brute force in its approach.

It is currently only a ConsoleApp.  If I improve the its solving-speed to an acceptable level, I'll make a pretty GUI for it.
